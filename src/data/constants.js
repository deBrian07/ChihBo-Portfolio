It involves machine learning and other algorithms such as Information Theory and entropy. It has it’s own simulation which can be used to debug and modify the algorithm, in which it generates N (an integer) wordle games and perform the word-guessing process. At the end it will calculate the average amount of steps of N games. ",

      "Spatialized Motion Sound Localization (SMSL) is a self-monitoring method that simultaneously estimates camera rotation and sound source location. It uses twin models trained on synchronized audio-visual data to mimic human spatial awareness without labeled data. The visual model predicts camera rotation, while the sound model estimates sound direction using binaural sound. A unique cross-view binaural mask helps the model understand spatial changes in both modalities. SMSL also includes a simulation tool that creates N audio-visual scenarios and calculates the average accuracy, indicating high performance.",

The simulation demonstrates secure, decentralized transactions in a P2P (peer-to-peer) system. Analyzing the RBJ network, we observed the impact of wallet interaction and transaction volumes on coin value. Comparison with larger networks like BNB highlighted scalability and liquidity possibilities for smaller coins. Our results show that advanced features are necessary to improve network resilience.",
